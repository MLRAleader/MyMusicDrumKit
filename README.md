# MyMusicDrumKit
Drum Kit is an interactive web application that transforms the keyboard into a musical instrument, putting into practice event handling, the DOM and audio in JavaScript.

The project focuses on user interaction, keyboard event handling, and synchronization between visual and auditory actions.
It was designed to enhance my understanding of browser-side JavaScript while developing the ergonomics and design of a simple and modern interface.

🎯 Project Objectives
    >Create real-time interaction between the keyboard and the interface
    >Understand how to handle sounds in JavaScript
    >Improve the user experience with visual feedback
    >Strengthen the fundamentals of frontend development
